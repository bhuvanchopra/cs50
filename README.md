# cs50
It is a repository of all my programs written for solving problem sets in the CS50 course of Harvard University.

It is a C program that encrypts messages using Caesarâ€™s cipher, as shown below:

$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: URYYB

The program takes a number(a key) from the user and equal to that many spaces, it shifts the alphabets to the right in the alphabetical 
order. For example, if the key entered is equal to 2, the program will encrypt A as C, B as D, Z as B and so on.

In cryptography, this type of program is used to provide encryption to secret messages.
