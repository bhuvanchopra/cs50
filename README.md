It is a repository of all my programs written for solving problem sets in the CS50 course of Harvard University.

It is a C program that reveals a hidden message in a BMP(Bitmap) image.

The program is provided with a clue.bmp image file. The image file is processed as a matrix of hexadecimal values of colors in each pixel. This image contains some noise in the form of red color. Our goal is to remove this noise and create a clean image file that contains a hidden message.
