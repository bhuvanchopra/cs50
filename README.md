# cs50
It is a repository of all my programs written for solving problem sets in the CS50 course of Harvard University.

It is a C program that prints out a half-pyramid of a user specified height as shown below:

$ ./mario
Height: 5
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######

$ ./mario
Height: 3
  ##
 ###
####

I implemented this program with some if and for loops.
